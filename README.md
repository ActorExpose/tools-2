<h3>IP to ASN Library </h3>

Library for converting IP addresses to their respective ASN/Org/location information. Includes functionality for reading from a text file and exporting to a .xlsx file.<br><br>

(BTW credit goes to the MaxMind database for City, Country, and ASN DBs included here. Find them at https://www.maxmind.com/en/)<br><br>


<h3>IP to ASN Maltego Transform</h3>
<b>Requirements:</b><br><br>

<a href="https://docs.paterva.com/en/developer-portal/transform_libraries/">[Maltego Transforms Library]</a> - This is the Maltego Transforms Library. Place it in the same folder as the IPtoASN.py file, and when you import it into Maltego, be sure to use this directory as the working directory<br><br>
<a href="https://github.com/vikingSec/tools/blob/master/IPtoASN/IPtoASN.py">[IPtoASN Library]</a> - Seems obvious but this will be necessary as well. Same as above, place it in the same directory as the iptoasn_maltego.py file and the DBs folder.<br><br>

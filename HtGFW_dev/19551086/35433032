Jafar Saniie and IIT, 你们想逼死我还不够，还想抢我的成果吗？你们是学校还是强盗团伙？我的论文在哪里？

我的一篇会议论文，去年4月份录用，五月会议，同期的论文去年10月份2017年就已经发表在IEEE Xplore 上了，我的现在还不见影子，多次跟会议主席联系，去年10月份，跟他们联系是说，他们的会在2到3个月后把我的论文放在 IEEE Xplore中， 半年过去了，论文根本就从为加进去，会议主席和出版主席各种扯皮，找各种借口，丑态百出，这就是学术界，想抢学生的成果，机关算尽，手段用尽，脸皮丢尽。大家看下面我给他们的回信。烂学校，烂导师，就是想在各种扯皮中，把学生耗死！掠夺，再掠夺，不要脸！我的论文呢？抢吧，强盗！当一个组织和机构开始不要脸了，什么都已经无法阻挡他们掠夺和谋杀弱者的行动。别人有导师出钱发论文，别人有导师亲历亲为指导，我导师从不指导，出结果想办法把你开除，用尽各种关系抢劫你的成果，这群窃贼，强盗。中国的留学生好欺负，你们就想怎么欺负就怎么欺负，对吗？光是为了发这一篇会议论文，就花了我1000多美金，别人发论文有导师出钱出力，我出成果导师抢，学校帮着导师抢，抢我钱还不够，还要抢我所有成果，赶尽杀绝，不是？论文题目，大家可以搜这个标题： Ultrasonic Echo Spike Detection using ℓ1-regularized Sparse Deconvolution网上还能找到一些蛛丝马迹，就是没有在 IEEE Xplore里，说好的要给我加上去的，全都是欺骗人的缓兵之计！不要脸的窃贼和强盗！天打雷劈！这是我发给IEEE Xplore出版主席的信的截图：以下是这封信的具体内容：Hi Afshin,I have no idea what the procedures that you should proceed to make a paper to be published. You told me these procedures are asking for me to do your job for you? All that I had done is exactly follow the instructions of the what the IEEE conference provided. And you now told me, you never receive the file to publish, or my paper is a poster paper but not an oral paper, or my paper comes with copyright line and page number issue which is not accepted (see the attached another email that you sent to me or screenshot 1 below), or you need this and that after almost one year later of the conference. What else are you gonna to tell me about the next?  Besides, all of these, I totally have no idea what you are talking about, could you please show me the documents that make you believe so? Since my idea has exposed in the presentation, what if someone steals from me and make them published, will you take responsibility for such consequence? can you compensate my loss? Let me telling you guys again here, I have right to my work to get published, it can not be deprived because of your guys wrong operations and you guys have no rights to hurt me again and again! How can you treat me like nothing no matter how many requests that I have been made? How can you just ignore them? For the email (1), Afshin, please do not use the word 'repeat' in your email because you never ask me such questions before. Mar 13, 2018, is the first time that I was told that my paper has copyright line and page number issues although I have no idea what you are talking about ! Show me the document which makes you believe so.For the email screenshot (3), Afshin, could you please tell me what makes you commit that it takes up 2-3 month to make my paper to be published in IEEE Xplore on Nov-07-2018 after you questioned about copyright line and page number thing on Oct 16, 2017 (screenshot 2)? Hamid updated me immediately after he got your words on Nov-07-2018 if you see the highlighted time marker in the below email screenshot (4).For the email screenshot (6), March 09 2018 11:43 am, Afshin, are you sure according to IEEE rules, poster papers cannot be published in the Xplore? Is this the fact rule of IEEE? Which document makes you think that my paper is a poster instead of normal paper so that you cannot publish it? Again, could you please show the document to me?For the email screenshot (7), March 09 2018 8:13 pm, Afshin, if Hamid never forwarded the file to you, where did you come up with your questions about copyright line and page number on email screenshot (2) of Oct-16-2017 and email (3) on Nov-07-2017 between you and Hamid?For the email screenshot (8), March 09 2018 12:22 pm, Afshin, July 5, 2017 ( screenshot 5), Hamid did say that some issue is about my paper, but you said that you never received any updated on it. Again where did the email (2) on Oct-16-2017 and email (3) on Nov-07-2017 between you and Hamid come from?Let's go back to your last email. When the time passed, you are telling me that everything has its timeline to make a paper published and what you are doing is only to try to help to publish, if people do not satisfy your work, they can go for another person? Is that what you try to express? Do you enjoy when those requests come to you to ask you give them a favor? If you are not, you really should start at the very beginning.Please do answer my questions first before we go to the next step!In (6), are you sure according to IEEE rules, poster papers cannot be published in the Xplore? Is this the fact rule of IEEE?If Hamid never forwarded the file to you, where did you come up with your questions about copyright line and page number on email screenshot (2) of Oct-16-2017 and email (3) on Nov-07-2017 between you and Hamid?In (5), July 5, 2017, Hamid did say that some issue is about my paper, but you said that you never received any updated on it. Where did the email (2) on Oct-16-2017 and email (3) on Nov-07-2017 between you and Hamid come from?

斯诺登是卖国贼吗？

泻药之前我在quora上看到这么一个问题Why do some Americans believe Edward Snowden is not a hero?Why do some Americans believe Edward Snowden is not a hero?有一个美国人写的挺有意思的。What Snowden did could be considered extremely irresponsible, he has overruled the judgement of security chiefs and councils, which have invested millions of dollars and man hours to develop and refine the most effective method of terrorism-prevention they can. One contractor has potentially jeopardised the safety of citizens across a vast number of nations, who use similar methods to track down terrorists. Terrorists have already adapted their methods of communication as a result of Snowden's revelations to become more covert and uninterceptable. Perhaps the next 9/11 will be conceived using different communicative technologies, whereas it would have been conceived on technologies that the NSA could intercept and therefore prevent the attacks. Snowden could be personally responsible for the blood of thousands of Americans. What he may have perceived as morally right and perhaps heroic, could be the root cause of America's next catastrophe.斯诺登的所作为是极其不负责的，安全委员会投入了数百万美元和人力来开发和完善这个系统，是为了更好的预防恐怖主义，但是被他搞砸了。这个系统有可能会危害到许多国家公民的安全，但也可以用同样的方式来追捕恐怖分子。由于斯诺登的爆料，使得恐怖主义情报变得更加隐蔽和难以捕捉，恐怖分子已经调整了他们的交流方式。也许下一个9.11将根据现有的美国国家安全局能够拦截并阻止攻击的技术构思，将会采用完全不同的技术。斯诺登将来可能要对数千美国人的鲜血负责。他可能被认为是道德上的正确，或许是英雄主义，但也可能是美国下一次的根源。在这个美国人眼里，虽然这个系统 jeopardised the safety of citizens across a vast number of nations，但是斯诺登搞了一个大新闻，将来美国要是出了什么偏差的话，斯诺登要对 the blood of thousands of Americans负责的，morally right and perhaps heroic算不上什么。美国国家安全比全地球公民隐私重要多了。

<b>(From my Research Prospectus)</b><br>
With the advent of the internet, it was not long until those in power began to use the web for their own political. This subversion of the web took the form of propaganda, offensive security operations (hacking), and surveillance of internet users. Big data allowed for a boom in communication breakthroughs, not the least of which was surveillance and big data profiling of internet users. One of the frequently ignored issues brought about by the web revolution, though, is not what is being done or what is being said: it is what is being left out, what is being hidden. Censorship can take many forms, whether complete deletion of material online to the use of threats, coercion, or policy made to influence what users can and cannot say. That isn’t to say that all censorship is bad, as one must consider the censorship of pornography, for example, to be a good thing in the majority of cases. When the power to censor falls on a party with an agenda, though, censorship takes on a much more 1984 vibe. <br><br>
	One of the biggest purveyors of online censorship is the People’s Republic of China, the architects of the Great Firewall of China. The GFW is a plethora of technical and non-technical apparatus that are in place to monitor, surveil, and censor data on the mainland China, as well as to purvey propaganda that adheres to strict Communist Party guidelines. This apparatus uses human controls and technical surveillance systems to watch, listen, and censor material, whether “censor” takes the form of post deletion, IP-address banning, physical surveillance, or arrest. The CPC insists that this censorship of social media platforms is in place in order to ensure the safety and security of the homeland, with critics insisting it is used instead as a political tool to ensure a placated populous, especially in times of upheaval.<br><br>
	My project, therefore, is an attempt to scale the Great Firewall and allow a look over the edge. This technical approach is essentially two-parted: the first is to create a Python-based web-scraping tool aimed at popular Chinese social media site Zhihu (??). I will manually input potentially sensitive topics, such as politics, democracy, hacking, and history, and let the web-scraper gather posts in these topics. The second portion of the project is to analyze the data for signs of censorship, gathering data about posts that are censored in order to discern key words, topics, and personalities that are more subject to censorship. The analysis will take popularity, content, and political climate into account, and check for signs of censorship that include, but are not limited to, post and comment deletion, obvious changes in the post content, and potentially automated “botting” of the post, or flooding the post with negative comments by bots.<br><br>
	By the end of the research, my project should allow for a quantitative and qualitative data set on the true scale of the censorship of Chinese social media. This can allow us to understand what political topics are taboo during times of upheaval, what mechanisms are being used to censor the Chinese web, and inform the general public of the dangers of a vast surveillance and censorship regime like the Great Firewall. This quantitative and qualitative look will have inherent objectivity and could allow for valuable insight into Chinese culture, language, politics, and social media technology.<br><br>

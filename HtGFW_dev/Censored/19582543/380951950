大家讨论下，特朗普在任职期间被弹劾的几率有多大？

看到底下有个说事实的，然后把我拉黑了。。。哈哈哈。我就偏个题贴几个事实吧。川皇撒谎：你川说USPS每给亚马逊送一个包裹亏1.5块钱，事实是，有人建议USPS如果把包裹的对外价格（不是针对亚马逊的价格）提高1.5， USPS就不亏钱了。你川说他跟普大关系很好[“He’s probably very interested in what you and I are saying today, and I’m sure he’s going to be seeing it in some form, but I do have a relationship with him and I think it’s very interesting to see what’s happened.” 2013 MSNBC采访 ]，[“the relationship (with Putin) is great, and it would be great if I had the position I should have.” 2015],[a gift from Putin – an award and a beautiful letter" 2015 每日邮报采访]然后说，他不认识普大。["I don’t know Putin. I think it would be great if we got along with Russia because we could fight ISIS together, as an example. But I don’t know Putin.” 2016总统辩论]然后["We have signed more legislation than anybody. We broke the record of Harry Truman." 推特 Dec. 2017] 。 但事实上，他发推那天他签了94个。杜鲁门在头一百天签了126个，更不要说一年了。 同期布什签了102个，克林顿签了209，老布什242。他差不多是总统里面的垫底的。。。等等等等。有空写个川皇诈骗集锦。哈哈哈。但是呢，川粉都看不到的。仗着大多数川黑都懒得认真写，整天就在那骗墙民。

From the lens of Urban ConstructionInvestment Bonds (UCIBs) issued by Local Government Financing Vehicles (LGFVs),we study how intergovernmental fiscal transfers impact the issuance of UCIBsunder China’s unitary system. After the application of instrumental variableestimation, we find special-purpose fiscal transfer per capita is positivelyassociated with the issuance of UCIBs：specifically，an increase in the special-purpose fiscal transferper capita by one yuan RMB is associated with an increase in the issuance ofUCIBs per capita by 0.282 yuan RMB; whereas, regular fiscal transfer (includingtax rebate and general fiscal transfer) has nothing to do with the issuance ofUCIBs. Furthermore, the effect of special-purpose fiscal transfer on theissuance of UCIBs mainly exists in the inland cities instead of coastal cities.This imposes the risk of Eurozonization for the Chinese economy. A furtherstudy also finds the deterioration of refinancing in terms of issuing moreUCIBs.Keywords: Intergovernmental Fiscal Transfers, LocalGovernment Debt, UCIBs,Eurozonization

如何用英语向外国友人解释「友尽」？

I'm not sure why you want to joke about ending your friendship, but any of the following sentences can be used in a joking way if you say it with the right tone and at the right time. Be careful though!More direct ways:We can't be friends anymore.I don't want you to be my friend anymore.I can't handle all the toxicity in our relationship anymore, so I think we should end it.More indirect ways:Our friendship has run its course.We're at different stages in our lives, and our friendship just isn't working right now.Let's be the kind of friends who talk to each other only every 10 years.It's not you; it's me.I hope this is helpful, but I won't take responsibility for anyone ruining their friendships. :P**************************************栗子的知乎答案索引：栗子树栗子的微信公众号：E-Speller 或者 栗子英文 （只有精彩的原创）**************************************

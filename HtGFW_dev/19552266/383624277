能说tomorrow was...吗？

"Tomorrow was" is incorrect. I would write "the next day" or "the following day" instead of "tomorrow". This article has lots of other mistakes. Please don't use it as an example for writing. I highlighted all the mistakes I found in the picture below. See whether you can correct them and find more mistakes!I think it might be confusing, because we can use "tomorrow" and "were" in the subjunctive. For example, "I wish tomorrow were Friday", but "I wish tomorrow was Friday" is wrong.I hope this answer is clear and helpful.**************************************栗子的知乎答案索引：栗子树栗子的微信公众号：E-Speller 或者 栗子英文 （只有精彩的原创）**************************************

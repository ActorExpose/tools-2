如何评价 Kanye West「黑人400年的奴隶制是一种选择」的言论？

看东西，真的得看上下文。。。When you hear about slavery for 400 years. For 400 years? That sounds like a choice. You was there for 400 years and it’s all of y’all. It’s like we’re mentally in prison. I like the word prison because slavery goes too direct to the idea of blacks. Slavery is to blacks as the Holocaust is to Jews. Prison is something that unites as one race, blacks and whites, that we’re the human race.这哥们确实是说大实话了，只不过通常来说大实话是左左不爱听的，所以就要断章取义了。

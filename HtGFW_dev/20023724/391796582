如何评价特朗普希望取消对中兴的制裁？

四个字：谈判筹码。请注意看他的话，是“找一个解决方案“，而不是“取消制裁“。换句话说，如果谈好了，就能找到解决方案了；反过来，如果谈不拢，就找不到解决方案了呗。这个连反川的WP都看明白了。Penalties against China telecom giant ZTE become a bargaining chip as White House, Chinese officials discuss potential trade dealWith Trump’s tweet, some officials familiar with the ZTE issue believe a compromise is possible. “A mini-deal is in sight,” said a person familiar with the matter. “China gets relief for ZTE, and in exchange agrees to return to the status quo for U.S. agriculture,” easing tariffs and implementing other non-tariff remedies.再看看这个消息，中国重新开始审核Qualcomm对NXP的收购案：https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-14/china-is-said-to-restart-review-of-qualcomm-s-proposed-nxp-deal另外，建议看看川老头子接下来的推：https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/995746011321597953China and the United States are working well together on trade, but past negotiations have been so one sided in favor of China, for so many years, that it is hard for them to make a deal that benefits both countries. But be cool, it will all work out!最后，至于北韩问题在里面有多大作用，目前来看很难讲。

如何评价「特朗普首次承认曾向艳星付封口费，称“在富人中很普遍”」？

川老头子说的是：Mr. Cohen, an attorney, received a monthly retainer, not from the campaign and having nothing to do with the campaign, from which he entered into, through reimbursement, a private contract between two parties, known as a non-disclosure agreement, or NDA. These agreements are very common among celebrities and people of wealth. In this case it is in full force and effect and will be used in Arbitration for damages against Ms. Clifford (Daniels). The agreement was used to stop the false and extortionist accusations made by her about an affair, despite already having signed a detailed letter admitting that there was no affair. Prior to its violation by Ms. Clifford and her attorney, this was a private agreement. Money from the campaign, or campaign contributions, played no roll in this transaction.他先前的说法是：记者: Did you know about the $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels?Trump: No.记者: Then why did Michael Cohen make it, if there was no truth to her allegations?Trump: You’ll have to ask Michael Cohen. Michael’s my attorney, and you’ll have to ask Michael记者: Do you know where he got the money to make that payment?Trump: No. I don’t know.那么问题来了，根据已知的情况，Trump在哪个环节上说谎了呢？

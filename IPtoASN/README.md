<h1>IP to ASN QuickScript </h1>

Quick script I wrote to take a text list of IPs and export them to an EXCEL file with ASN and location data. May be useful for threat hunting stuff. Included a test file with 5 ips that were said to be malicious online.<br><br>

(BTW credit goes to the MaxMind database for City, Country, and ASN DBs included here. Find them at https://www.maxmind.com/en/)<br><br>
<b>Usage:</b><br>
python ./ipInfo.py [path to text file]<br>
